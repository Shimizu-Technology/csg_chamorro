### What Each Folder Does:

**`lib/`** - The main code
- This is where your actual Ruby code lives
- `lib/csg_chamorro.rb` is the "entry point" - it's what runs when someone does `require 'csg_chamorro'`
- `lib/csg_chamorro/version.rb` stores the version number
- Ruby convention: main file name matches the gem name

**`bin/`** - Command-line executables
- Contains scripts that users can run from the terminal
- `bin/csg_chamorro` is the CLI tool
- After installing the gem, typing `csg_chamorro` in terminal runs this file
- Must start with `#!/usr/bin/env ruby` (tells system to run it with Ruby)

**`test/`** - Automated tests
- Contains test files that verify your code works
- `test/csg_chamorro_test.rb` has 11 tests
- Run with: `ruby test/csg_chamorro_test.rb`
- Uses Minitest framework (comes with Ruby)

### What Each File Does:

**`csg_chamorro.gemspec`** - Gem specification
- Tells RubyGems everything about your gem
- Name, version, authors, description
- What files to include in the gem package
- What dependencies it needs
- Required for building the gem

**`Gemfile`** - Dependency management
- Lists gems your project depends on
- In our case, just says `gemspec` (use dependencies from .gemspec)
- Run `bundle install` to install dependencies
- Creates `Gemfile.lock` with exact versions

**`Rakefile`** - Task definitions
- Defines shortcuts for common tasks
- `rake word` - print a random word
- `rake list` - list all words
- `rake test` - run tests
- `rake version` - show version
- Like npm scripts, but for Ruby

**`README.md`** - Documentation
- First thing people see on GitHub
- Explains what the gem does
- Shows how to install and use it
- Includes examples

**`LICENSE.txt`** - Legal stuff
- MIT License (very permissive)
- Says others can use, modify, and share your code
- Required if you publish to RubyGems.org
